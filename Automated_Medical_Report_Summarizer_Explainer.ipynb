Physical examination revealed bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema more pronounced in the right eye compared to the left, accompanied by a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field deficit and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes were unremarkable; sensory testing indicated intact responses to light touch, pin prick, vibratory stimuli, and proprioceptive input. Maculopapular rashes noted bilaterally over the lower limb areas.

Follow-up imaging revealed displacement and tilting of the filter toward the right ivc wall, causing penetration through the opposite side and extension into the left renal vein. Subsequent treatment included catheter-directed thrombolysis and stent implantation in the common iliac veins and ivc without attempting initial removal due to significant clots present inside the filter. Current management involves continued administration of warfarin as per physician recommendation.\n",
            "Assessment: The patient requires further intervention to address the complication arising from the previously placed ivc filter. Surgical thrombectomy resulted in displacement and tilting of the device, necessitating subsequent procedures such as catheter-directed thrombolysis and stent insertion.

Intraoperatively, the affected maxillary sinus mucosa was found to be entirely replaced by inflamed tissue, which could be separated cleanly from adjacent structures. Histology confirmed non-specific inflammation consistent with sinonasal polyposis, ruling out infectious etiologies like fungal infections.

There is no associated neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, Raynauds phenomenon, oral ulcers, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity. Past medical history includes occasional episodes of left knee and testicle swelling but no known exposure to toxins or unhealthy lifestyle practices such as smoking, alcohol consumption, or illegal drugs. Currently employed as a flooring installer.\n",

Physical examination revealed bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema more pronounced in the right eye compared to the left, accompanied by a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field deficit and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes were unremarkable; sensory testing indicated intact responses to light touch, pin prick, vibratory stimuli, and proprioceptive input. Maculopapular rashes noted bilaterally over the lower limb areas. Laboratory studies demonstrated microcytic anemia with decreased hemoglobin levels 11.6 gmdl, hematocrit 35.3, MCV 76.9 fl, elevated ESR 33mmhr, CRP 13.3mgdl, and low serum sodium concentration 133mml.\n",

There is no associated neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, Raynauds phenomenon, oral ulcers, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity. Past medical history includes occasional episodes of left knee and testicle swelling but no known exposure to toxins or unhealthy lifestyle practices such as smoking, alcohol consumption, or illegal drugs. Currently employed as a flooring installer.\n",

Physical examination revealed bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema more pronounced in the right eye compared to the left, accompanied by a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field deficit and a relative afferent pupillary defect. Muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes were unremarkable; sensory testing indicated intact responses to light touch, pin prick, vibratory stimuli, and proprioceptive input. Maculopapular rashes noted bilaterally over the lower limb areas. Laboratory studies demonstrated microcytic anemia with decreased hemoglobin levels 11.6 gmdl, hematocrit 35.3, MCV 76.9 fl, elevated ESR 33mmhr, CRP 13.3mgdl, and low serum sodium concentration 133mml.\n",
